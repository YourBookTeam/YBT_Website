  summary: [
    "1943. WWII wreaks havoc upon Poland. The Nazis send the entire population of the Grodno ghetto to the trains. Except for those who managed to escape.",
    "A boy flees through dense forests, seeking survival. As Nazi patrols close in, the scent of his fear draws the vicious soldier dogs near. He must find a place to hide.",
    "In his desperation, he reaches a cabin at the forest's edge. Inside, a Christian woman catches sight of him through the window and immediately understands. She faces an agonizing choice: should she open the door and risk her family's safety to save this boy, or turn him away to protect her own?",
    "In war, acts of kindness become acts of defiance."
  ],
  milestones: [
    "Transformed flat self-published manuscript into a vivid, emotionally rich novel",
    "Now leading a YA literary franchise with a YA adaptation of Under the Floorboards",
    "Four books in development: Maria's Promise, War Sisters, Love in Berlin",
  ],
  challengeText:
    "John had a passion project: a historical novel based on queer love during WWII. But the original manuscript lacked emotional dimension, narrative pacing, and the voice to compete in today's market. It felt unfinished—and wasn't connecting.",
  strategicPivotText:
    "We restructured timelines, enriched character arcs, and brought his voice into tighter focus—preserving his personal flair while sharpening the emotional stakes. We revised the framing, tightened themes of love and resistance, and made every word carry weight. We also advised on next steps to expand his world into a broader series.",
  results: [
    "The revised Under the Floorboards reads with emotional precision and literary maturity.",
    "John is now positioned as a historical fiction author with a clear, socially relevant voice.",
    "On track to create a literary brand that bridges personal identity with historical storytelling.",
