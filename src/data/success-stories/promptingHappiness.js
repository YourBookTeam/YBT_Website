  challengeText:
    "As a tech-savvy lawyer and founder, Nimrod had insights at the intersection of AI, therapy, and self-improvement but his manuscript lacked clarity and cohesion. It read like a stream of ideas, not a strategic book that could position him as a thought leader.",
  strategicPivotText:
    "We worked closely with Nimrod to transform scattered content into a compelling narrative. Through deep editorial coaching and emotional structuring, we helped him find his voice while aligning the book with his brand and intellectual goals. A custom-designed cover captured the soul-meets-software concept. The result? A book that reads with clarity, conviction, and resonance.",
  results: [
    "Prompting Happiness hit bestseller status and catalyzed Nimrod's personal brand.",
    "It led to podcast interviews, press features, and new deal flow through audience growth.",
    "He became recognized not just as a startup founder, but a provocative thinker on emotional tech.",
    "He's now building a Prompting Trilogy with us: Prompting Harmony (in progress) and Prompting War (next).",
