  challengeText:
    "As a tech-savvy lawyer and founder, Nimrod had insights at the intersection of AI, therapy, and self-improvement but his manuscript lacked clarity and cohesion. It read like a stream of ideas, not a strategic book that could position him as a thought leader.",
  strategicPivotText:
    "We worked closely with Nimrod to transform scattered content into a compelling narrative. Through deep editorial coaching and emotional structuring, we helped him find his voice while aligning the book with his brand and intellectual goals. A custom-designed cover captured the soul-meets-software concept. The result? A book that reads with clarity, conviction, and resonance.",
